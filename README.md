# Introduction

## Document Structure

There are three groups; Scripts, Scenes, and Prefabs. Each of these groups represents a game resource category and within those categories, we divide them into subcategories \(namespaces or folder in the engine\).

* **Scripts** - everything about the game's script is stored in here. This generally means all \*.cs files that are inside `/Assets/Scripts/`
* **Scenes** - important game scenes that require an extra explanation for developers. This generally means all \*.unity files that are inside `/Assets/Scenes/`. Not every game scene needs to be documented!
* **Prefabs** - important prefabs used in the game. This generally means all \*.prefab files that are inside `/Assets/Resources/Prefabs/`. Not all prefabs will require documentation.

## Script Documentation Guide

Scripts are categorized by subfolders within the `Scripts` folder or namespaces. For example, the Player section refers to the player folder, not the `Player` class in the game.
