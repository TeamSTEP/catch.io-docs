# Release Platform

## Target Platform Specs

This project is expected to be released on console platforms and mobile devices. Due to cheating concerns, PC will only be supported through browsers \(WebGL\). However, we will have to discuss the feasibility of this as browsers do not provide a lot of hardware resources for the game.

For development purposes, the target platform specs will focus on mobile systems. Once the PC release has been made, the team will slowly port the project onto other platforms.

The minimal target specs will be similar to those of iPhone 8. The minimal hardware specs will be like the following:

* RAM: 2GB
* Screen resolution: 1920x1080px
* CPU clock rate: 1.5 GHz
* Game size: less than 4GB

The game scene and assets will be based on 640x480px screen with a unit size of 32px. Therefore, every visual asset should be treated as if the screen is 640x480 big.

The size of the throwable objects should be 16 pixels at max. It should have realistic proportions in relation to the character size.

## Platform Release Strategy

Witch One will first release for **PC** \(Windows and macOS\) browsers, therefore the controls and interface will be focused on PC players with minimum specs. The PC version will be the _Minimum Viable Product_ for the team. This MVP will be used for marketing and attract funding for the project. The release channel for the MVP will be on itch.io and browser application on the team's homepage. The marketing of the MVP will be done for about a month.

Once the project has gathered more than 1000 players and proper funding from investors, we will aim for a Steam release that is estimated to take about a month. This process will be worked on parallel with the mobile port of the project.

The mobile platform release will start with the Android version for Google Playstore. Next will be for iOS devices on Apple Store.
