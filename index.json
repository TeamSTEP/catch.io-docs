If you are part of development team, feel free to add new tasks or comment on existing ones. Every information that is required for developing with the Project Catch.io team will be documented here. Such information includes: Project folder structure Coding styles and guidelines Project contribution format (semantic version for this project, Pull Request format, etc.) Milestones and progress reporting methods Team roles Documentation format and more... You can think of this as a general guideline and a starting point for joining the team or unifying how our works should be prevented in order for them to be considered 'finished'. To keep things organized, project members should document their work and tell everyone how you want others to handle your work. Please keep in mind that you are not expected to read all the docs, but you are expected to understand the parts that is related to your task. Project Resources All resources and documents related to the development of project Catch.io is split amongst various repositories, sites and services. We will list all of them here and explain what their purposes are. Some links listed here will not be accessible by the public while some are. Please change the list content if we decide to make adjustments to the team management structure. Catch.io Project Repository: The repository for the source code of project Catch.io. This repository is made private, and we only allow access to project developers. However, contents like code documentation or ongoing test builds will be made available to the public with the power of Github CI. Catch.io docs repository : The source code for project developer references are kept in this repository. Currently, this repo contains two different document pages. Project Development Manual : Hosted via Github Pages, this page contains the auto generated scripting reference for this project. The content of this page will change with every update made to the Catch.io source code. It is convenient, but hard to migrate to other pages as this does not use Markdown for API references (only code manuals are in Markdown). Google Drive Shared Folder : Internal documents, weekly meeting records, brainstorming records, project expenses, art/music assets for the project and other information that are meant to be stored for a long time and only meant for team members will be stored here. Non-programmers will mostly interact with Google Drive. Itch.io page : Itch.io is used for sharing quick prototype builds of the game (in WebGL for most cases) both inside and outside the team. Generally, this page is used for quick internal testing, but we may consider releasing the game here at some point. Trello Project Board : Still experimental, but this is where the development progress regarding Catch.io will be tracked. Catch.io GDD : Hosted by Gitbook, this page contains everything about the project such as the game mechanics, expected features, rough timeline, expected release platforms, general marketing strategy, pivot strategies, and more. Abbreviations & Definitions To increase the efficiency of communications between members, it is good to use abbreviations. If there are any abbreviations (and the definition of that word) you are using that is foreign to other new members, please add it here. PR: Pull Request (when merging a branch or a fork to the master repository) Repo: Repository (Git repository) doc: Documentation (Projects documentation like this one will be referred to as docs) WIP: Working In Progress impl: short for implement or implementation LGTM: Looks Good to Me (used when a PR does not have any issues and is good to merge) Scripts: Refers to the .cs code that contains game play logic, but are not directly used as part of a Unity game object Components: This is also a .cs code, but it is meant to be used as a component for Unity game objects How to Write Documents Project docs like this one must be written in Markdown. You can use stackedit.io to write a quick doc, or use the Markdown All in One extension for VS Code. Documentations should be long and comprehensive so anyone can understand. As a general format, think of this README doc as a template to start from. Q: What should be a doc Anything that requires more than one people to work on either now or in the future. Or if you have any special requirements regarding your work or working style, write a doc to express that to other members. Q: Who can write a doc Anyone within the team. You will need other's permission to edit an existing doc (except for fixing typos or obvious problems), but creating a new one is completely up to you. Q: Any word requirements It should be comprehensive, but not boring. There are no strict word count, however it should be long enough to let the reader understand what you want to say and short enough to not make the reader fall asleep."

    "title": "Art Asset Structure | Catch.io Developer Reference",
    "keywords": "Art Asset Structure This section will describe how art assets for Catch.io should be structured. Directory Every art assets used in the game (excluding UI) is stored in Assets/Textures/ . This includes character sprites, environmental objects, throwable objects and map tile sets. Everything relating to the UI such as menu, title, inventory icon, etc will be stored in Assets/Textures/UI/ . Asset import settings When importing the assets to Unity engine, the file settings should be like the following: Texture Type: Sprite (2D and UI) Sprite Mode: Multiple or Single Pixels Per Unit: 32 Filter Mode: Point (no filter) Compression: None When slicing animated sprites, it is recommended to use the Grid by Cell Count method. You can find the detailed image import setting inside the Assets/Editor/Presets/InGameSpriteImport_Default.preset preset file. Submitting Assets For artists who are submitting their work, it is recommended to upload the work to Google Drive Team STEP/Projects/Project Catch.io/Sprites/ folder with the appropriate name of the sprite that is being added. Because Google Drive does not send responsive notifications for uploading images, the artist will have to notify the developer that their work has been uploaded via Slack. Folder Structure Animated character sprites will be placed in the Characters/ folder with the name of the character as the root directory. Inside this folder, there should be a subdirectory that describes the action (ex: Characters/Shade/Walking/ , Characters/Shade/Running/ , Characters/Shade/Crouching/ , etc.). The actual image file will be saved within those folders. Completely optional, but it is recommended to create source folder as well that stores the original work file in any format as a backup solution (ex: Characters/Shade/source/running.aseprite ). Image Format It is recommended that the final asset is saved as .png , but Unity supports a vast number of image formats, so as long as the file can save alpha channel data or layer data (if required), the artist can save it as any format as they want. For any animated sprites, it is recommended to separate the sprite asset into animation sheets like the following sample animation. Character sprites should be separated into each direction where a single image contains all the frames for that direction. The asset file name should be prefixed with the action and suffixed with the direction that the character is facing with a space in between the two. The direction should be named as the cardinal direction (ex: Run NE.png , Walk S.png , etc.). To summarize all of this, character assets should have the format of Characters/{Character Name}/{Action}/{Action Direction}.png . Theses are some examples: Characters/Shade/Walking/Walking NW.png Characters/Shade/Running/Running N.png Characters/Shade/Throwing/Throwing SW.png Item/Torch/Torch1.png Item/Frog/Red Frog/Back.png Asset Color Palette Both characters and props must follow the following color palette to keep a consistent feeling for the visual assets. A single component of an asset (such as metal, gold, cloth, etc.) should be within 2 variations of light to dark palettes/color. Feel free to be creative, but the main idea is that for artists to make an object (e.g a wooden barrel) it should use the same wood colors as the trees in the environment for consistent visuals."

    "title": "Coding Style | Catch.io Developer Reference",
    "keywords": "Coding Style This section will discuss the naming convention of code, files, github branches, etc. If you find any files with inconsistent naming, please fix them accordingly. C# Naming Conventions Because Unity uses C# as its preferred language, the standard C# naming conventions will be used within this project. This scheme will apply to C# script names as well. For further details regarding C# coding conventions, please refer to the following documents: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/general-naming-conventions https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/interface https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-classes-structs-and-interfaces https://blog.submain.com/c-interface-definition-examples/ https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/types-of-relationships-in-object-oriented-programming-oops/ Everything else will mostly be kept consistent with Unity/C# conventions, but for this project, we will not be having the m_ prefix for component variables in Unity. Namespaces All C# scripts that are inside the Assets/Scripts folder must have a namespace to it. The namespace should be CatchIo.<folder name> , where the <folder name> is replaced with the folder that the script is in. Unity Asset Names Every asset used within the Unity engine will use the Upper Camel Case (ex: MainCharacter.prefab or GrassLandTileSet.png ). These assets include everything from tile maps, sprites, object prefabs, shaders, etc. Scene names should be in Camel Case as well as items within the scenes too. It's discouraged to use spaces for game object names, but not mandatory as there are some generated objects that does include a space in the name (ex: Main Camera ). Style Rules This project uses EditorConfig to maintain its code style. Some style rules have been disabled due to compatibility with how Unity handles C# scripts. These settings will be automatically read by Visual Studio. For developers using VS Code, we have stored a pre-configured workspace settings and recommended extensions in the .vscode folder for easy configuration. The repository for this project will check for the code style via dotnet-format for every PR. This check must pass in order for new code to be merged to the main branch. Formatting Code Although both VS Code and Visual Studio offers a built-in code cleaner that can be triggered for every save, we found that there are some style rules won't apply with this method. So we recommend using the development version of dotnet-format tool. You can install this tool by using this following command from your terminal: dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format --version 5.0.142902 --add-source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-tools/nuget/v3/index.json To format the entire script folder, you will have to first open a script in Unity with Visual Studio so that Unity engine can generate the .csproj file. Once that is done, use the following command from the root of this project folder: dotnet-format Catch.io.sln --fix-style warn"

    "keywords": "Setting up the development environment Game Development Environment Unity Engine The development for Witch One (development title Catch.io) will be in most cases, done in Unity. We recommend installing Unity Hub as it supports various OS and can install multiple versions of the Unity Editor. Installing Unity Hub You can install the latest version of Unity Hub through this link or check the official download page . Note that for Linux users, the link above will download the .AppImage executable of Unity Hub. Alternatively, you can install Unity Hub through the Pop!_Shop in Debian variant systems. Engine Version Currently, we are using Unity version 2021.1.19f1 (5f5eb8bbdc25) . You can check the official release archive from this page , or install directly via Unity Hub by clicking this link . For Linux users who run Unity through an .AppImage executable, the deep link installation provided by the Unity release archive may not work. Instead, you will have to pass the deep link URL as a parameter for the application file from your terminal. ./UnityHub.AppImage unityhub://2021.1.19f1/5f5eb8bbdc25 Configuring Unity Editor Setting The Default IDE You can change your preferred IDE/Editor in Unity by going to the Edit -> Preferences -> External Tools menu. Regarding how to install the IDE and text editors, please refer to the next section. General Development Environment Version Control Software Git & GitHub Our team uses Git as the main version control software, and GitHub as the repository host: Team STEP GitHub Account Installing The Git Client Most IDEs offer a way to interact with the remote repository. If you have a preferred Git client, you are free to use it. For most developers, our team recommend using GitHub Desktop, as it offers a robust GUI, auto-configuring the global Git settings, and automatically updating repository submodules. You can install GitHub Desktop on Windows 10 and macOS from the official website: GitHub Desktop For Linux users, you can install a fork of GitHub Desktop maintained by Shiftkey ( releases ) For Windows users, we also recommend installing the Windows Git client that comes with the Bash terminal. Bash on Windows allows you to access applications installed with PowerShell as well. Downloading Git . Setting Up IDE & Text Editors Visual Studio Community Note: Visual Studio Community is not supported on Linux systems When working with Unity, we generally recommend using Visual Studio, as it provides full support for Unity including breakpoints and unity game object component reference checking. Although Unity will ask you to install Visual Studio before you install the engine in Windows, you might want to have a full installation of Visual Studio if you need extra features. In which case, you can install the IDE . MonoDevelop Note: MonoDevelop is not a requirement for developing on a Linux environment. The guide below adds the package repository from Ubuntu 18, as that is the only way you can install it on later versions . MonoDevelop is an open-source cross-platform IDE that supports languages like C#, F#, Visual Basic .NET, and Vala. You can find more information on their homepage . Generally speaking, MonoDevelop is considered to be a replacement for Visual Studio for Linux systems. If you're using Windows 10 or macOS, we recommend installing Visual Studio Community instead of MonoDevelop. This installation guide will assume that the user is working on Ubuntu-based systems (LTS 20.04 or up). First, add the Mono repository to your system. # update your repository. Upgrade any packages if you have to sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade # install the basic dependencies sudo apt install dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates # add the mono repository key sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF # add the app repository to your apt source sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-bionic main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list' # refresh your repository list sudo apt update Second, install the full MonoDevelop package and the IDE # install the full mono package sudo apt install mono-complete # install the monodevelop IDE sudo apt install monodevelop # install the .Net NUit unit test packages sudo apt install monodevelop-nunit Lastly, check your installation # this command should output the compiler version if your installation was complete mono --version Your IDE should look something like this: This guide was based on the article written by Website For Students . Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code is a lightweight text editor (until you install a boatload of extensions) for developers on all major platforms. There are several Visual Studio Code extensions that work with the Unity Engine. It does not support everything that Visual Studio can do with Unity, but we recommend install VS Code as it is great for development that is outside of Unity (such as web development, or PR review/resolving merge conflicts). You can install Visual Studio Code from here . Visual Studio Code must be configured properly before it can work with Unity. This is the list of recommended extensions that we use at the time of this writing. extensions.json { \"recommendations\": [ \"editorconfig.editorconfig\", \"aaron-bond.better-comments\", \"ms-dotnettools.csharp\", \"jchannon.csharpextensions\", \"streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker\", \"unity.unity-debug\", \"donjayamanne.githistory\", \"felipecaputo.git-project-manager\", \"github.vscode-pull-request-github\", \"formulahendry.github-actions\", \"eamodio.gitlens\", \"yzhang.markdown-all-in-one\", \"davidanson.vscode-markdownlint\", \"tobiah.unity-tools\", \"ptd.vscode-unitymeta\", \"redhat.vscode-yaml\", \"dotjoshjohnson.xml\" ] } settings.json { \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"EditorConfig.EditorConfig\", \"markdownlint.config\": { \"html\": true, \"MD033\": false, }, \"[jsonc]\": { \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"vscode.json-language-features\" }, \"omnisharp.enableEditorConfigSupport\": true, \"editor.formatOnSave\": true, \"cSpell.words\": [ \"Tilemap\", \"Tilemaps\", \"gameplay\", \"royale\", \"tileset\" ] } Editing the contents of the .vscode/ folder in the root directory of the project allows the developer to change the default setting for developers working in VS Code. This means that all developers with a new installation of VS Code has to do is open VS Code from the root of the project folder. Android Studio Android Studio is a cross-platform IDE for developing applications for Android devices, commonly with Java and Kotlin. Our team will rarely develop directly in Android Studio, but installing it allows us to easily install different versions of Android SDK, or access other development tools like the Android Device Emulator. Plus, Android Studio is available for most commonly used OS, so if your disk space can handle it, we recommend installing it from their official installation page . System Terminal and Package Manager Windows 10 - Chocolatey No sane developers will use Windows for its terminal or package management, but here we are. This section will guide you through installing Chocolatey , a package manager for Windows. Windows system comes with PowerShell and the Command Line Prompt as its main terminal. Alternatively, you can install Bash that comes with the Windows Git client (mentioned in the previous section). For this guide, we will be using PowerShell. To access PowerShell with administrative rights, click on the Windows search bar on the bottom left corner of your screen (next to the Windows button in the task bar), and search for PowerShell . Right-click on the app and choose Run as administrator . When you open the terminal, it should look something like this: Note that administrator sessions runs from Windows\\system32 instead of the user home directory. Paste the following command to your terminal. Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')) This should install Chocolatey to your system. You can confirm it by using the choco command to your terminal. You can read the detailed installation process from the official installation page . macOS - Homebrew Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. It offers a wide variety of applications that are a must-install for developers working from macOS. Unlike Windows; macOS comes with a zsh terminal, which shares a lot of characteristics of bash. This means that most commands that works with bash will work on your Mac. To install Homebrew, you simply open your terminal from the Utilities folder and paste the following command. /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" You can learn more from the official Homebrew page."

    "title": "Git Guide | Catch.io Developer Reference",
    "keywords": "Git Guide Branches and Forks The basic idea of branches and PRs is, when implementing a new feature for most projects, you would create a branch that is only for that feature. When the development is done you would open a pull request and merge it with the master. We will elaborate on this idea and create a single standard as game development involves many moving parts that rely on each other and it is important for everyone to be on the same page with this. There will be mainly four types of branches. fix branch: a branch name that is used for commits for patches or fixes that address a bug that came from the feature branch. This does not add anything new in terms of features, but only refactors them. Ex) fix/throw-object . feature branch: branches that add something new to the game which may break the game or not. Because of how game development works, commits in this branch will inadvertently act similar as the fix branch (and it is fine to do that as long as you record it!), but one key difference is that feature branch must add something new. Ex) feature/ai-sensors . development branch: these are the branches that are in active development. They have a very strict rule. First, the name must be the semantic version name. Second, every feature and fix branches must be derived from this branch and merge back to it when finished (no branch should derive from other branches). Lastly, after merging the development branch with the master branch, the development branch should not be touched at all. Ex) development/v-0.0.1b document branch: this is a special branch that is used exclusively for PR that adds documentation to the repo In short, branches with the name development must be derived from the master while the fix and feature branches derive from the latest development branch. Only development branches are allowed to merge with master . However, you can only merge when there are no fix or feature branches, and once you merge you can only create a new development branch, no direct commits to master unless the situation calls for it . Merging a development branch to the master branch will be part of a Milestone . Forking works similar to the fix and feature branch. You can freely fork a development branch and merge back to it. But you should never fork and commit to a fix / feature branch unless you made a new one or you have to! Versioning Scheme By default, projects will use the Semantic Versioning as the base for the versioning scheme. Versions are generally used in three different places. Github tag/dev branch names In-engine version In-game graphical version display In-engine version and the In-game graphical version display will be linked together, allowing the developer to only focus on working with the in-engine version numbering. Those will have to be changed manually. Github version names will be taking the form of development branch names like development/v0.1.3a and will also be the name of Github's Projects feature and Milestones feature. The naming scheme for branch names will be like the following, development/v[major].[minor].[patch][alpha/beta] . The major number is when we add a huge feature that may change the game as a whole. One example would include a multiplayer mode for a single player only game. Adding on to this, minor versions are additional feature that does not affect the game play flow to a huge degree, but does add something new to the existing game. For example, a new character model or new items. Patch numbers are generally when a game changes its backend code that the end-users does not notice right away and updates that does not add something visible to the game. Like bug fixes and gameplay balancing. Using Git Projects and Progress Tracking Todo: This section is outdated. We use Notion as our main project management tool. Please update this. For tracking the development process, we will be using Git Projects. Git Projects is an automated Kanban for understanding what tasks should be done, what is in progress and what is finished. For this project we will be using the automated Kanban, meaning that issues will be automatically added to the Projects Kanban. Project names should be the development version that the project will have. If all the items in the Project are considered to be finished, you can open a new milestone and merge that version with the master branch. After that you would create a new Project with a new version name. For adding items to the Kanban, please create a new Issue with the appropriate label. When adding a new feature to the game, create a new branch with the prefix feature/[feature-name] and open a new issue with the label enhancement . For fixing bugs or other patches, create a new branch with the prefix fix/[patch-name] and open a new issue with the label fix . When you open a new issue, that item will be automatically added to the Project Kanban. GitHub Projects is just a simple method to check the overall progress of the working project and to understand what the developers should be doing. As long as the developer understands to open an issue and creating a new branch before making any changes, there should be no problem. Opening Issues As mentioned above, the project's development progress and assigning tasks will be done via opening issues on the repository. Because of this, it is important to understand the format for opening one in a consistent way. Issue Title: The title of the feature/fix that the assigned developer will make. Description: The detailed description of what this task will be adding. It is best to add a list of things that will be done. Assignees: This shows the developers who will be taking on the task that the issue describes. Labels: The category of the issue. Mostly it will be either enhancement or fix . Projects: The project that this issue will be committing to. This should always be the latest working development build before it is committed to the master branch. Milestone: This shows which development build this issue belongs to. Preventing Merge Conflicts When using Git for version controlling game projects, the team will definitely encounter several critical conflicts. This generally stems from the following reasons: Too much noise - most heavy game engines will create a lot of meta files for various reasons. This is always automatically generated by the engine, which makes it hard to predict how it is going to change. Furthermore, this will clog up the changed file list for each commit and pulls which makes reviewing hard. Too many file types - most engines will use their custom file types for managing game objects or settings. Sometimes this will result in files being treated as binaries rather than code. Most cases these are just markup languages with a special file extension, but this still makes it hard for developers to review other's code. Large files - not completely related to merge conflicts, but using large media files like .wav or .png makes syncing and merge a time consuming process. So how can we prevent merge conflicts when working with a big team? There is no single solution for this, but we can come up with commit standards to ensure that we can avoid critical errors. The following guide will be based on using Unity with Github Work on a new scene - if you are adding a new feature or item, create a new scene or duplicate one of the existing scenes and only work on that. This ensures that no scene conflicts will ever happen. Only focus on your feature - not limited to game development, but for any collaborative working environment, it is best to only stick on your feature and not try to work on something that is not related to it. Create/override prefabs - always make a prefab for game objects that will be used throughout multiple scenes. Furthermore, before committing to the repo, do not forget to update your prefab."

    "keywords": "In-Game Tilemap System In this page, we will focus on summarizing two popular tilemap frameworks that we can consider for our project. Available Tilemap Frameworks There are a couple of options you can choose when creating a tile-based 2D game in Unity. All frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses that the developers should consider and commit to that framework to allow the core mechanics to have a consistent performance. Unity 2D Tilemap Unity 2D Tilemap is a tilemap component that Unity offers within their engine. Because it is part of the engine, this framework is highly compatible with most components and other tools within the Unity ecosystem. Plus, it is very flexible when it comes to adding custom features. You can learn more about extending the Unity 2D Tilemap framework from this GitHub repository . Despite the strong support that Unity 2D Tilemap receives from both Unity and the community (hey, that rhymed!), there are limitations that the developer should consider before fully committing to it. One such limitation is with the in-engine editor, as it lacks a lot of tile selection tools and built-in brushes. Another limitation is how complicated the custom brush implementation is alongside the difficulty of extending the existing tilemap framework itself. Pros: Highly compatible with the base engine and other assets Ability to create custom brushes and tile logics Easy composite collider Great documentation Great support from the community Completely free Cons: Difficult to extend the core tilemap component Difficult to create usable custom brushes All tiles are saved as a separate prefab in the project (hard to migrate) Lack of effective custom tile property injection Helpful resources: Unity tilemap manual Tilemap component tutorial Super Tilemap Editor Super Tilemap Editor is a 3rd-party Unity asset that can be bought from the Unity Asset Store for $45. This asset (or plug-in) allows you to create and use 2D tilemap in your game scene. The tile system is based on the position within the specified atlas image, whereas Unity will create a prefab for each individual tiles from a sprite image. Overall, Super Tilemap Editor is a robust package that offers easy in-engine map editing tools. Thanks to the fact that the source code is available to the developer, you can extend and change the plugin from its core. However, Super Tilemap Editor has trouble with importing TMX (Tiled Map Editor XML) files despite it claims to provide full support for it. In addition to that, Super Tilemap Editor lacks in proper documentation or community support compared to that of Unity Tilemap. Pros: Highly expandable Optimized tiling system Robust editing tools Supports tile metadata and custom properties Easy to use Can export tilemaps as prefabs Cons: Not free Lacks in documentation Community size is small compared to Unity Tilemap Issue with importing from TMX files Helpful Resources: Unity forums release thread Super Tilemap Editor Official Page Super Tilemap Editor Documentation"

    "title": "Level Design Guideline | Catch.io Developer Reference",
    "keywords": "Level Design Guideline Game Mechanic and Level Designing Project Catch.io heavily relies on passive mechanics that affects the gameplay-flow. Passive mechanics are game mechanics that the players are expected to always be aware of and actively utilize to win without having a dedicated button to execute it. Examples of such mechanic includes: Visible sound waves Player footprint Environmental objects You can learn more from Game Mechanics and Features section of the game design document. Map Sections This project is expected to have an average of 15 players in a battle-royale-style death-match. A full game map will be divided into small sections that can be either a set of tilemap prefabs or multiple scenes combined together. The level designer will only need to focus on designing these map sections, rather than making the full map at once. Player spawn-points are manually placed by the designer to ensure that the game is balanced for everyone. To keep the map designing process simplified, a single map section will be large enough to handle three player spawn-points , where the distance between any given spawn-point must be more than 64 tiles . This means that the entire map must contain at least 5 sections. The above image is a rough approximation of how the player spawn-point and map edges will be placed. In here, we assume that the space between each spawn-points in a single section is 64 tiles apart. Please note that this is just an example of how the map sections can be combined. The level designer can change the size of a section, or change how they are placed if they need to do so. Map Elements Aside from the visual style, the level designer will have to consider the following elements when making a map. Map Surface: All levels will have a base ground tile and a special surface tile. These surface can leave footprints, generate sound with a higher volume, or slowdown the player. Player Spawn-points: As mentioned above, player spawn-points are manually placed by the level designer. When a player enters a game, they will spawn randomly from a set of locations defined by the designer. Offensive/Evasive Items: Offensive and evasive items are objects that players can keep in their inventory and throw it with the throw button. These items are the primary source of gameplay that allows the player to either attack the other player, or run away from certain situations. Level designers should be mindful of where they should be placed and how many should be accessible in a given section. Consumable Item Spawn-points: Consumable items are essentially health potions for replenishing player's sanity value. Potions use the same inventory slot as the offensive/evasive items, but they are not re-usable once consumed. To keep the gameplay flow going and prevent players dying from lack of potions, consumable items are spawned in a fixed location that only spawn to the location with the least players in the area. Environmental Objects: Environmental objects are map props that is part of the map design. They are not meant to have any player interaction, instead, they are meant to be a static object. However, environmental objects can cast shadows or block bounce-off projectiles, which means that they can be used as a hiding spot or an ambush spot for the player. Light Sources: These are part of the environmental object group, however, instead of being a hiding spot for the player, this will become the area that exposes the player, as players will only be visible to other players when they are being lit. Buildings and Houses: Similar to environmental objects, buildings are a static prop that is part of the map. However, they do not come in a fixed size like a tree would. Players are expected to use buildings and houses as a landmark for map navigation and hiding. Story Telling: When designing a level, the designer should tell a story for each object they place. This aspect of level designing will not be emphasized for the vertical slice of the project, but the release version should be able to tell the game lore and place objects in a way that stays consistent with the story that the designer is trying to tell."

    "title": "Map surfaces in Tiled | Catch.io Developer Reference",
    "keywords": "Map surfaces in Tiled Last Edited: November 5, 2021 2:06 PM Status: Draft Type: Manual Game Map Architecture The scripting aspect of the project may change depending on the implementation. In order to keep the development flow going, it is important for us to separate the level designing process from the level feature implementation. We do not want the level designers to wait for some coding task to finish or lose their work when we change or optimize the tilemap system. At the same time, we want a flexible and powerful editing tool that allows the level designer to abstract the features. That is why our team had to use external tools for map designing instead of keeping everything in Unity. This guide will describe how you can create a map \"wireframe\" for Catch.io using Tiled. Note that this guide assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of all the tools used in this project and therefore, will only describe the parts that are unique to Catch.io's map design process. Creating a Map Using Tiled What is Tiled There are many options when it comes to implementing 2D tilemap systems in Unity. To keep the project development flow clean, we will use a map editing tool called Tiled. You can download the latest version from the official site . Alternatively, you can compile it from the source . Tiled is a map editing tool that reads and saves the map information as a tilemap file with the extension .tmx which is a form of XML. Tiled comes with various powerful tools and features that make 2D map designing easy. You can add custom properties to petty much everything starting from the map down to the individual tiles. Thanks to this feature, it is possible to create a concept map that contains features that are not yet implemented in the game. Our project uses Tiled as the main map designing tool, therefore, designers can directly link Unity prefabs and tile properties within Tiled. To learn more about what this tool is capable of, please refer to the Tiled official documentation . Tiled Project File All the maps, worlds, tilesets, object templates, and types used within Catch.io are managed by a single project file ( .tiled-project ). Keeping a project file as a single source of reference for all the Tiled files allows us to keep a consistent working environment across different designers. The Tiled project will be part of Catch.io’s source code under the folder TiledMapEditor/ . The location of this folder may change depending on how we decide to import the map data to Unity, but as of this writing, the folder will be in the root directory of the project ( TiledMapEditor/CatchIoLevels.tiled-project ). Tiled Project Folder Structure For our project, we will have the following folder structure: extensions : Contains the Tiled editor extension scripts that can be used by the designer. This folder is a clone of the official extension repository . You can create new extensions and just add them to this folder. The editor will automatically parse through the content. Maps : Contains the TMX tilemap file that the designer will directly work on, plus the automapping rules entry point. All game levels designed in Tiled should be saved in this folder. Rules : A subdirectory of Maps . This folder contains the automapping rule maps that will be used in this project. All TMX files used here must be referenced in the rules.txt file in the Maps folder if you want the editor to read them. Schemes : A folder that contains a world file. In short, these are the main file that combines the smaller .tmx files into a single large playable map that will be imported to Unity. Templates : Contains the map object template file. Objects are useful when you want to reference a Unity prefab or other complicated game-specific logic that is difficult to add using Tiled. When you create an object that is used in other maps, please create a template of it and save it in this folder. Tileset : Contains the tileset information that is used in the map. The tileset source image will always be inside the Assets/Textures/Tileset or Assets/Textures/Props folder. This means that all the tilemap used in Tiled are based on the raw sprites that are read by the game engine. Tileset should match the sprite name that it is based on to reduce confusion. Types : Contains the map object type data. Using types allows the object to have a consistent property which makes it easy for the Unity importer to handle them later on. All types are kept in a single .xml file, so every time you add a new type, you should overwrite the existing one. However, be careful not to change the file name as they are referenced by the .tiled-project file. Naming Schemes In our project, the file naming scheme will differ depending on its type. For general naming styles, we have; PascalCase : .tmx files (tilemap), .world files (tile world), tile layers, terrain names, folder names, and all custom property key-values, .tx files (object templates), object types ( Types/ObjectTypes.xml ) are written in this case. For example, GrassLand.tmx , BorderColliders layer, custom property surface:Terrain : Ground , etc. snake_case : only .tsx files (tileset) are written in this style. For example, cave_decorative.tsx . kebab-case : only .js files (JavaScript Tiled extensions) are written in this case. Note that folders inside the extension folder are also written in this style too. Maps and Layers Tilesets Our game works on an orthogonal 32x32 tilemap. So when you create a new tileset, please ensure that it contains the following properties: Orientation: Orthogonal ObjectAlignment: Unspecified GridWidth: 32 GridHeight: 32 The tileset source image will be stored inside Assets/Textures/Tileset/ , which is the same location as the in-game tilemap object texture. Terrains All environmental tiles should have a defined terrain so that they can be drawn with the terrain brush. Terrains are essentially a simple Wang Tile algorithm. Defining the terrains in a tileset allows the designers to use terrain brushes for auto mapping. You can learn more about creating terrains in Tiled from the official documentation . As you can see from the image below, the type of terrain is represented by a color code, and the rules are defined by its shape. However, Wang Tile patterns in Tiled can only work on a per-tile basis. Meaning that multi-tile high objects like cliffs cannot be expressed purely using terrains. Automapping or rule tiles can solve this. For example, we use a brute-forced one-to-one mapping to automatically add the bottom half of the cliff when the designer places the top half of the cliff on the map. For more information, please refer to the official documentation . Tilemaps In most cases, our tilemap will need the following property values: Orientation: Orthogonal TileWidth: 32 TileHeight: 32 Infinite: true TileLayerFormat: Base64 OutputChunkWidth: 16 OutputChunkHeight: 16 TileRenderOrder: RightDown And the following are custom properties to configure the sorting layer and object tag of the tilemap when it is loaded to Unity. For most maps, we use the following default values: unity:SortingLayer: GroundTilemap unity:Tag: Tilemap Layers Our game will only use the Tile Layer and the Object Layer (however we do use the Group Layer to clean up the map layers). Tile layers are used for drawing the map while object layers are used to place custom map objects that are used to either import Unity prefabs to the scene or to add a line collider to the map. Layer rules Layer names must use the PascalCase without any space. All tile layers must be separated based on the type of surface and the sound effect it generates, not the terrain type. For example, our game has two variants of grass terrain. However, they can be in the same layer as both of them will generate the same sound effect. Tile layer names must represent the surface type. Object layers are limited to SpawnPoints , Items , Environment , and Colliders . Readable Surfaces A readable surface in Catch.io is defined by the custom property of a tile layer. To add layer surface information, click on a tile layer and add the following custom properties. surface:LeavesMark: \"bool\" surface:Terrain: \"string\" surface:Volume: \"float\" Note that surface-related custom properties will have the prefix surface: . For example, a mud layer can have the following custom properties. surface:LeavesMark: true surface:Terrain: \"Mud\" surface:Volume: 4.0 surface:LeavesMark : This property will determine whether or not if the surface will leave a footprint when the player walks on top of it. surface:Terrain : This property will define the sound effect that will be played when an object like the player or throwable items interact with the surface. Note that the string value of this property must match the label value for parameter Terrain in event TerrainSfx . The string value of this custom property is directly passed to the FMOD plugin. surface:Volume : This property will determine the lifetime of the sound wave that is emitted when an object interacts with the surface. The actual volume of the sound effect is defined in FMOD. Adding Unity Prefabs from the Tilemap In Catch.io , the designer should be able to define player spawn points, item spawn points, and other environmental objects directly to the game map without having to open Unity. To do this, we use map objects with custom properties that point to the prefab file in the project's assets folder. All objects that are going to be replaced as an actual prefab in the game scene are represented by a point object which can be created by using the Insert Point(I) option when clicked on an object layer. Click on the point object that you wish to change, and choose the type Prefab for the property Type . This will add the custom property prefabSource which contains the file path of the prefab within the Assets/ folder. The unity:FlipX and unity:FlipY properties are used to flip the prefab sprite in the game. Note that once you define the values, the game will replace the point object with the selected prefab in the exact location, layer, and name of the map object."

    "href": "manual/project-structure.html",
    "title": "Project Structure | Catch.io Developer Reference",
    "keywords": "Project Structure This chapter will discuss the file structure of this project and how the project should be organized. Because of how game development works, this chapter will change depending on what type of assets we add to the game. In such situation, please update this doc to the corresponding changes so no one is confused to where things are stored. Core Folder Types This project will have the following core folder types: Audio - contains every asset that is in an audio format like background music, in-game sound effects, UI sound effects, background sound, etc. Editor - C# scripts that are specifically made for the Unity Editor to support development. Game-affecting logic does not belong in this folder. Gizmos - Similar to the Editor folder, this folder will contain all visual assets that are used for the editor, like inspector icons or other visual indicators. Materials - Contains all material assets (in the format of .mat ) that are used in the game. Plugins - Third-party libraries from the Unity Asset Store or helper scripts that does not change frequently and is compatible with other Unity projects should be stored in this folder. Resources - contains all game object resources like object prefabs, rule tiles, scriptable objects, etc. Scenes - games scene will be in this folder Scripts - every script that is directly made for the project belongs in this folder. Shaders - shader files will be in this folder. Textures - every 2D image files will be in this folder. This includes tile map, character sprite, UI elements, etc. Structuring Code General Structure Note: This section is outdated and will need revision in the near future It is recommended that all scripts are Duck-typed (use logical naming and inheritance/interface for all scripts that will be expanded in the future) and use inheritance to neatly wrap the function of each component. This means that scripts with similar functionality should be wrapped with a parent class that inherits from MonoBehaviour (or another class that inherits from it like MonoBehaviourPun ). The same logic will apply to folder structuring as well. Interacting with the UI In Unity, scene elements and the code are kept separate, as they only communicate through an event callback. So scenes that requires user interaction through UI elements must have a scene manager or a UI handler object of sort. To increase code scalability, the HUD or menu UI objects should be kept separated from the backend logic that handles the data for UI to display. Instead, allow the UI controller script to interact with the scene objects and relay the user input into a handler script. This can resemble a simplified version of the MVC pattern. In this model, the UI behavior script and the scene manager script should be in the same game object so that the manager script can access the UI behavior script via .GetComponent<T>(); . Folder Structure Because the project source code is expected to grow and change with every new feature added to the game, it won't be practical trying to limit the number of code sub-folders in the game. Instead, this section will define the categories of the source code that we expect to be bundled in a folder. A single category can be split into multiple folders, or sub-folders when needed. It is good to keep the actual name of the folder should be descriptive enough for people to understand, but this document will not try to come up with any as we want the developers to change the name or add more when they have to. Folders should be kept flexible and descriptive. Furthermore, developers should keep all components and data types on a separate script and try to group all similar codes into a folder. If a component behavior script becomes hard to categorize into a single folder even though they share similar characteristics, let it inherent from a parent class that implements those behaviors and place the child script into their own folders that best describes them. Because all game-related .cs files are expected to be stored inside the Assets/Scripts/ folder, the code category listed below will describe the general folder structure inside the Scripts/ folder and nowhere else. This means the following definitions will not be applicable to codes inside Editor/ or Plugins/ folder. Core classes - The core types and components that are used to build other game components. Everything in this category are not expected to be used directly in the game. Instead, they should be the template for creating new components. This will also include custom types that does not inherit from anything. UI controller classes - Components specifically for controlling the UI or in-game HUD. Most, if not all of them should have using UnityEngine.UI; in one way or another. Interfaces/Enums/Struct - It is best to keep all the interface, enum, data structure code into a separate folder, as it allows the team to understand what interfaces are written by us and which ones are from a 3rd party library. Utility classes - These classes are static functions that is only used to prevent writing the same method inside a component over and over again. Scripts in this category are expected to be used throughout different components without any dependency issue. Map prop classes - All components that are used for environmental objects but is not directly controlled by the player should be kept in the same folder. For example, a script for opening a door. Sound manager classes - Sound (music and SFX) is a crucial game play aspect for Catch.io, so we can expect separate scripts that handles this logic. Controllable object classes - All scripts and components that are meant to be directly controlled by the client (aka, the player components) should be kept in the same folder. These should not be confused with the UI controller classes, as those are independent of the player object. Game manager classes - Components that are meant to handle the backend processing of a scene will be organized into its own folder."
