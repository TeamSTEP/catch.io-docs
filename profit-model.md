# Profit Model

Catch.io is a free-to-play cross-platform online battle royal. The main source of income will be through Google Adsense and other online advertisement services during its early stages.

Ads will be displayed for players who are under third place in the session and are in the game over screen.

The ad panel will be displayed for 10 seconds. This will not be skippable and players who finished seeing the 10-second ad can start a new game session. Players who are within the third place will not need to see the ad to start a new session.
